I arrived in Ireland October 2012 for undertaking a PhD supervised by <a href="http://nhcooper123.github.io/">Natalie Cooper</a> on Primates evolution. Looking back, the start of the whole endeavour seemed really stressful to me (new country, new customs, new language) and the project as much frightening (<a href="https://thepalaeoscene.wordpress.com/2015/10/01/what-do-you-actually-do-in-your-first-week-of-your-phd/">what do I do?</a>, where do I start?, will I be able to do it?)... What happened after was way <strong>below</strong> my expectations: these three years were <em>everything but</em> stressful and frightening!</p>

These days I’m writing up the discussion of my sensitivity analysis paper on missing data using the Total Evidence method (more about it <a href="http://www.ecoevoblog.com/2014/10/06/phd-pretty-huge-disaster/">here</a> and <a href="http://www.ecoevoblog.com/2014/10/13/phd-positive-happy-developments/">here</a>). One evident opening for proposing future improvement on my analysis is the obvious &quot;let’s-do-it-again-with-more-data&quot; one... But a recent <a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/content/346/6215/1320.abstract">Science paper</a> by Jarvis et al made me reconsider that. Is more the always better?</p>

In biology and among biologists, we like to use terms that we know are not correct but that still come in handy when you’re confident that your interlocutor understands them the way you do. I’m thinking of terms such as &quot;key adaptations&quot;, &quot;living fossils&quot;, etc... However, among them, there is one that particularly bugs me and makes me feel like Samuel L. Jackson in the iconic <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvEik9N_xWI">Pulp Fiction scene</a> and that is: &quot;the rise of the age of mammals&quot;.</p>

This is a mini series of two posts about finding positive things in negative results. Science is often a trial and error process and, depending on what you’re working with, errors can be fatal. As people don’t usually share their bad experiences or negative results beyond the circle of close colleagues and friends, I thought (and hope!) that sharing my point of view, as a PhD student might be useful.</p>
