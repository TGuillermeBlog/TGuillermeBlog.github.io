I arrived in Ireland October 2012 with the purpose of undertaking a PhD supervised by <a href="http://nhcooper123.github.io/">Natalie Cooper</a>  on Primates evolution. Looking back, the start of the whole endeavour seemed really stressful to me (new country, new customs, new language) and the project just as frightening (<a href="https://thepalaeoscene.wordpress.com/2015/10/01/what-do-you-actually-do-in-your-first-week-of-your-phd/">what do I do?</a>, where do I start?, will I be able to do it?)… What happened after was way <strong>below</strong> my expectations: these three years were anything but stressful and frightening!</p>

<p>OK, even though not everything went smoothly and it had to take the best of the personalities (that are thankfully common sights in Trinity College’s Zoology Department) for dealing with some ups and downs, here is my top 5 list of personal thoughts that always improved the two aspects of my PhD: the working aspect (the research) and the “social” aspect (feeling relaxed and enjoying it).</p>

<h2 id="be-ready-to-change-your-phd">Be ready to change your PhD</h2>
<p>As I mentioned in the first line, my PhD was supposed to be on Primates evolution. In t<a href="http://figshare.com/articles/Macroevolution_with_living_and_fossil_species/1583337">the end</a>, the world “Primates” is mentioned only once (and that is, buried in a sentence about several other mammalian orders). Of course, sometimes the PhD is a Long Quiet River if everything goes well and you keep your highest interest in the original topic. However, sometimes it changes completely! And this should never be a problem! The PhD should be allowed to evolve just as much as yourself (or more pragmatically: your field) evolves into these three or four years.</p>

<h2 id="failure-happens-to-everyone">Failure happens to everyone</h2>
<p>Another major part about the PhD (and about the scientific endeavour itself!) is that it will fail. More or less often and more or less dramatically in each case but failure should just be part of the process. As a early career researcher, you can learn a lot from the mistakes and the success of others. However, I found that there is nothing much more personally instructing than the trial and error. I already mentioned how my <a href="www.ecoevoblog.com/2014/10/06/phd-pretty-huge-disaster/">biggest PhD disaster</a> led to my <a href="http://www.ecoevoblog.com/2014/10/13/phd-positive-happy-developments/">most positive development</a>.</p>

<h2 id="stay-open-minded-and-curious">Stay open minded and curious</h2>
<p>Writing the thesis or even just doing the lab/computer work for the PhD can narrow your mind and highly <a href="http://www.ecoevoblog.com/2013/05/10/surviving-experiments/">decrease your sanity</a>. I found that the best way to avoid that was to try as much as possible to make the PhD only priority number two and put all the other things (seminars, meeting speakers, chatting/helping colleagues, etc…) before it. It has two advantages for the PhD: (1) you don’t work on it 24/7 and (2) everything you learn outside of it will actually be super useful for the PhD. In the Zoology Department, we were only a couple of people doing macroevolution surrounded by ecologists. Yet, I think my work benefited heavily from the influence from these people.</p>

<h2 id="dont-rush">Don’t rush</h2>
<p>One thing I found nice with the PhD is that before you even start – before day one! – you already know the final deadline. OK, at day one, the handing in date seems far away (3 or 4 years away actually!) but that leaves you plenty of time for doing awesome research, writing it down as papers/chapters (and even trying to publish them before the deadline) and going to the pub or to other non-PhD recreational events…</p>

<h2 id="chat-with-your-colleagues">Chat with your colleagues</h2>
<p>Finally, I found that I gained so much just by chatting with my colleagues. And by colleagues I mean my fellow PhD students of course but also with the post-docs and the staff. I always found a long term benefit to both PhD aspects, whether it was talking about the latests video games during working time (I’m not only looking at you <a href="https://twitter.com/yodacomplex">@yodacomplex</a>) or having heated debates about <a href="http://www.ecoevoblog.com/?s=species+selection">species selection</a> during coffee time.</p>

<p>I know much of these tips worked for me but might not apply to other people. In the end their is only one ultimate tip: make your PhD a hell of a good time!</p>
