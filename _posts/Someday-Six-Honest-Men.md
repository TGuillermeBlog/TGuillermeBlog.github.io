What is the link between colorful maps, boiling insects, the spread of disease, and hashtag killing equations? Macroecology obviously!

What? What is macroecology? The #EUMacro meeting was an excellent answer to that question (storify [part one](https://storify.com/nhcooper123/eumacro-part-1) and [part two](https://storify.com/nhcooper123/eumacro-part-2)). On the 14th June, along with people from 17 countries and three ecological societies (BES, GfÖ and CMEC), we met in Copenhagen for an excellent meeting to discuss all the exciting things macroecology.

Aside from the brilliant talks that were replete with all the right phrases from [Natalie’s macroecology bingo](https://gist.github.com/nhcooper123/eb0191a27be7d2aa91a0) we realised that maps are the ties that bind macroecology talks whereas maths remains the easiest way to [lose your audience](https://twitter.com/tomjwebb/status/610814958964707330). The conference also provided an occasion for acquiring much advice and thoughts for early career macroecologists as well as for not so early career types. We began with a nice opening description of macroecology by Carsten Rahbek as a science that asks ‘Kipling questions’: 

*I keep six honest serving men*

 *(They taught me all I knew);*

 *Their names are What and Why and When*

 *And How and Where and Who.*

We were implored to realise we’re not in science for the publication game, instead we’re there to find out how nature works. As a group perhaps we’re lacking in ambition, the physicists of the world have no problem asking for many millions of euros to ask their questions, so why don’t ecologists do the same? Should we receive such an amount we’d need to collaborate on an even greater scale which could put us in danger of going against Nate Sanders’ advice, don’t work with assholes.

The debate over the publication circus showed no signs of abating as a panel of experts gave a variety of views on the value of journals and publishers. There were concerns over the exponential rise in the number of manuscripts being submitted to journals and the impossibility of the current model to effectively deal with these rise especially when it comes to proper peer review. And the ancient issue of the profit margins associated with publications rose up again. 

During our workshop on critical innovation in ecology which was organised by the International Network of Next-Generation Ecologists (INNGE) we were discussing how best to ensure macroecology has an impact on society for the next decade and beyond when it comes to effective decision making. One problem as we saw it is that the public doesn’t know what it needs to worry about when it comes to ecological problems. By contrast in economics, a subject just as complicated as macroecology, the public hang onto key issues like GDP and unemployment rates as things to fret over. 

To wrap up the conference Carsten Dormann gave the entire subject a good grilling and told us all to leave our half-baked ideas in the shower.

To finish up the meeting we were treated to dinner in the wonderful surroundings of the Zoological Museum at the university where two-tusked narwhals and feathered dinosaurs watched over us as we ate.
