Thanks to the [DU ZooSoc](http://www.trinitysocieties.ie/society/104/zoological-society), TCD staff and students were treated to an exhibition from [Dublin Falconry](http://www.dublinfalconry.com/) last week.

Set against the busy backdrop of joggers and Pav-frequenters, six beautiful birds of prey were the stars of their own lunch time show. Here’s a few pictures from the event, just a flavour of the stunning animals which we were privileged to see, touch (and hear!) up close. And for the full effect, have a look at Keith McMahon’s beautiful [video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEbfH0wefbc&feature=youtu.be).
